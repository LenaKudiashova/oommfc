    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "OOMMF Calculator can be used on all major operating systems. To install it, please refer to the section for the opertaing system you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOMMFC\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On Windows, before we install `oommfc`, we need to install `Python3` Anadonda distribution. Therefore, download \"Graphical Installer\" for `Python3` (or \"Command-line installer\" for `Python3` if you are confident with command prompt) from https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows. After download is complete, run the `.exe` file and follow the instructions to install `Anaconda3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now we have everything required to install `oommfc`. Run in Command Prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install oommfc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to install `tcl` on your machine. To do this, download the `.exe` file from http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads appropriate for your Windows operating system (32-bit or 64-bit). After download is complete, run the downloaded file and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From http://math.nist.gov/oommf/software-12.html download the `.zip` file for the latest OOMMF version which is appropriate for your Windows (32-bit or 64-bit). After the download is complete, unzip (extract) this file. Locate among the the unzipped files `oommf.tcl` and remember its location. We are going to need it in step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In order to help `oommfc` find where `oommf.tcl` is, we need to set the value of environment variable `OOMMFTCL`. To do this, in Control Panel, select System -> Advanced system settings (tab Advanced) -> Environment variables. In User variables select `New...` and type `OOMMFTCL` for Variable name and `C:\\path\\you\\remembered\\from\\step2\\oommf.tcl` to Variable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## MacOS\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOMMFC\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On MacOS, before we install `oommfc`, we need to install `Python3` Anadonda distribution. Therefore, download \"Graphical Installer\" for `Python3` (or \"Command-line installer\" for `Python3` if you feel confident with terminal) from https://www.continuum.io/downloads#osx. After download is completed, run the `.pkg` file and follow the instructions to install `Anaconda3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now we have everything required to install `oommfc`. Therefore, run in terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install oommfc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To compile OOMMF on MacOS, make sure you have `XCode` (installed from the AppStore) and `git` (https://git-scm.com/download/mac) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. clone the repository:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/fangohr/oommf.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To compile OOMMF, change the directory (`cd oommf`) and simply run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, we have to set the environment variable `OOMMFTCL`, so that previously installed `oommfc` knows where to find OOMMF. Consequently, in your home directory, add the path to `oommf.tcl` file to the end of the `.bash_profile` file. More specifically, the line at the end of your file should look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export OOMMFTCL=\"/path/to/your/compiled/oommf.tcl\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Please note that after editing `.basrc` file, you need to refresh your environment variables**\n",
    "```\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "**or simply by opening a new Terminal window.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux (Ubuntu)\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOMMFC\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To install OOMMFC, we first have to make sure you have `pip` installed. **Please note that this command requires root privileges (sudo).**\n",
    "```\n",
    "apt-get install python3-pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, we can install `oommfc`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install oommfc\n",
    "```\n",
    "Although OOMMFC is installed, we now need to make sure OOMMF is available either on the host machine or via Docker containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can compile OOMMF on your machine by firstly installing required packages:\n",
    "```\n",
    "apt-get install git tcl-dev tk-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the repository:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/fangohr/oommf.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To compile OOMMF, change the directory (`cd oommf`) and simply run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, we have to set the environment variable `OOMMFTCL`, so that previously installed `oommfc` knows where to find OOMMF. Consequently, in your home directory, add the path to `oommf.tcl` file to the end of the `.bashrc` file. More specifically, the line at the emd of your file should look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export OOMMFTCL=\"/path/to/your/oommf.tcl\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that after editing `.basrc` file, you need to refresh your environment variables**\n",
    "```\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "**or simply by opening a new Terminal window.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "OOMMFC can run OOMMF simulations in two ways:\n",
    "  - on the host machine if OOMMF is installed, or if not,\n",
    "  - inside docker container.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Therefore, if you have problems running OOMMF on your machine, you can install docker, by following the installation instructions on https://www.docker.com/products/overview."
