    "make\n",
    "```\n",

    "Finally, we have to set the environment variable `OOMMFTCL`, so that previously installed `oommfc` knows where to find OOMMF. Consequently, in your home directory, add the path to `oommf.tcl` file to the end of the `.bashrc` file. More specifically, the line at the emd of your file should look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export OOMMFTCL=\"/path/to/your/oommf.tcl\"\n",

    "  - on the host machine if OOMMF is installed, or if not,\n",
    "  - inside docker container.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Therefore, if you have problems running OOMMF on your machine, you can install docker, by following the installation instructions on https://www.docker.com/products/overview."
